Using the cloudflare agents-sdk, create a cloudflare worker that receives a title (or title+author+format like Kindle) of a book and finds the Amazon storefront URL for it

add error logging. give me a sample curl to use. generate the index.ts and wrangler.jsonc. do not attempt to save previous searches. always perform from scratch. always use the agents-sdk.

migrations in wrangler.jsonc should just be new_sqlite_classes not that and new_classes
The browser field should be an object, not an array with a binding object.
